'''
A basic game wherein you navigate a rectangle around in zero-gravity,
avoiding the black hole, while trying to collide with the white hole.
Used to teach my students the basics of pygame.

Since these coords might result in the holes overlapping,
we use this wrapper function to make sure that doesn't happen.
